# MIPS-Single-Cycle-DSP-Extensions
SystemVerilog implementation of a Single-Cycle MIPS Processor upgraded with DSP extensions. Features include a Zero-Overhead Hardware Loop controller (Opcode 0x3F) and a Vector Multiply-Accumulate (VMAC) unit (Opcode 0x1C), achieving a 5.96x speedup on iterative vector calculations.
